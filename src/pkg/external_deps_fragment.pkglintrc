# This is a fragment of a pkglintrc file used for the pkg(7) build
# to acknowledge that some dependencies will be missing at lint
# runtime.  When used with a reference repository, we expect that
# these dependencies would be available.
#
# If version numbers are missing from the dependencies below, we
# match all versions of that particular package.  If version
# numbers are specified, we only match the given version.
