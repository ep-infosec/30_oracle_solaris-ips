# What we want to do is to transform all the pkg.fmri package attributes into
# depend actions and drop everything else.  The trick is to drop the depend
# actions already in the manifests but not the one we're generating.  So we
# tag our depend action with a true value, and default this tag on all depend
# actions to false.  Then we can just drop the false-tagged actions, and then
# delete the tag from ours.
#
# We do a similar trick for set actions, except the ones we want to keep come
# from the incorporation manifest itself.
<transform set name=pkg.fmri -> emit depend type=$(DEPTYPE) fmri=%(value) pkg.debug.keepme=true>
<transform file dir link hardlink license user group driver legacy signature -> drop>

#
# if any packages that we incorporate have a parent dependency on
# themselves, then we need to have a parent dependency on ourselves.
#
<transform depend type=parent fmri=feature/package/dependency/self -> default pkg.debug.keepme true>

<transform depend set -> default pkg.debug.keepme false>
<transform depend set pkg.debug.keepme=false -> drop>
<transform depend set pkg.debug.keepme=true -> delete pkg.debug.keepme .*>

# These transform the actions into the format they're already in in the wild,
# for comparison purposes.
<transform depend -> edit fmri ^pkg:/ "">
<transform depend -> edit fmri ,$(PKGVERS_BUILTON) "">

# Don't need to incorporate the incorporation!

# Exclude localizable file package which is internal
