These scripts are used to gather data and generate reports from the logs of
apaache servers sitting in front of pkg(7) depots.

To get started:

0) Get and install GeoIP
  - Retrieve GeoIP-1.4.5.tar.gz from:
    http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/c/
  - Retrieve GeoIP-Python-1.2.3.tar.gz from:
    http://www.maxmind.com/download/geoip/api/python/
  - Install those.

1) Set up directories/paths
  mkdir $HOME/mylogdir  # Path you will run the scripts from
  ln -s `pwd`/Makefile.data $HOME/mylogdir/Makefile
  ln -s `pwd`/site-config $HOME/mylogdir/site-config

2) Tell Makefile about these new paths (and other options)
  <edit Makefile.data>
  - change LOG_HOME to point to where the scripts live
  - change DATA_HOME to point to $HOME/mylogdir
  - change RSYNC_* to match your log path/server configuration
  - (optional) change AN_FLAGS to suit your needs:
        '-w <int>'  specifies the window (default 30 days)
        '-a <date>' specifies the start date for analysis

3) Site configuration
  <edit site-config>
  - change the hostname to the hostname of your depot server
  - modify excluded to your liking (country codes excluded from analysis)

4) Retrieve your logs
cd $HOME/mylogdir
make retrieve

5) Run the analysis scripts
make empty
make

This should generate you an index.html file, which you can serve via apache or
some other http server.
