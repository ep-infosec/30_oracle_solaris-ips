Quality Simulator
-----------------

Testing the transport quality metrics involved both live and simulated
testing.  This is the synthetic environment that was used to test how
the quality function behaves based upon various inputs and scenarios.

This can be built by typing 'make' in the project's directory.  Use
'make clean' to remove the cruft and copy in new versions of files.

The simulator contains the following files:

Makefile - build/clean the simulator

scenario.py - The scenarios that the simulator tests, as well the
classes that allow parameters about the simulation to be configured.

depot.py - A class that emulates a simulated aspects of a remote depot.
Parameters about the remote endpoint and its performance are defined
here.
